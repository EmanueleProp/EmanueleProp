Hi Dear Recruiter!

I’m @EmanueleProp and I created this website as a way to have a personal portfolio of my data work.
This is a just a small _recueil_ (for my French friends) of the things I am most confident with, but it is not at all exhaustive, as I am learning new programming languages as I write.
I’m interested in various and differet things, but those that I am currently most confident with are data analysis and visualisations, econometrics and financial analysis on R. 
I have a bit of experience with network analysis and data scraping, and at the moment I am currently learning SAS and Python. 

Withouth further ado, thank you very much for being here and I hope you will enjoy!
Emanuele
